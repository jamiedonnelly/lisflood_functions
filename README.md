# lisflood_functions

This folder contains a file with a collection of python functions that I have re-used for running, preparing and analysing simulations in lisflood-fp, a CLI 
based 1d/2d-coupled hydraulic model. 

Functions have been annotated with docstrings.

Requires base libaries, numpy and rasterio (https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/)
